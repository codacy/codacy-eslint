## Manually upgrading packages / plugins / configs

```shell
npm run upgrade
```

## Adding new packages / plugins / configs

Install the package / plugin using npm:
```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --omit=dev package-name
```

## Configuring new plugins

**NOTE**: Before adding a plugin to the Codacy UI, make sure it has widespread use and is actively maintained.

1.  If the plugin has descriptions for rules on GitHub, reference them
    at `src/docGeneratorMain.ts` to include them on the generated documentation.

    -   Add a section similar to the following example:
        ```typescript
        await docGenerator.downloadDocs(
          // plugin prefix (e.g., xss/some-pattern-id)
          "eslint-plugin-xss",
          // path to .md patterns files within github
          `/Rantanen/eslint-plugin-xss/master/docs/rules/`,
          // prefix for tag relases (for example if tags are "v.1.0.0" you have to prefix tags with "v.")
          // or "false" if package has no tags released
          // (default) "v"
          "v",
          // change to true if it should fail in case of missing .md files for any pattern
          // (default) false
          false
        )
        ```

    -   In `src/eslintPlugins.ts` add a new value to the array with the name of the package/plugin:
        ```typescript
        // make sure it matches the correct name of the package
        const packageNames = [
          //(...)
          "@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin",
          //(...)
          "eslint-plugin-xss",
          //(...)
        ]
        ```

2.  Generate documentation so it adds the new plugin documentation.

    ```shell
    npm run build:docs
    ```

3.  Add a new test in `/docs/multiple-tests` that uses the newly added plugin.
    You can use the Getting Started section of the package documentation to find a small usage example. 

## Generating documentation

```shell
npm run build:docs
```

## Test changes to codacy-seed locally

You may need to test changes that comes from our [codacy-engine-typescript-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-typescript-seed).

1.  Create a package with your changes on the seed:
    *   Don't forget to update the dependencies: `npm install`
    *   Compile the library: `npm run compile`
    *   Package the library: `npm pack`
    > This should generate a codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz on your codacy-seed repository

2.  Copy the `codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` into the root of this repository

3.  Install the package: `npm install codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz`

4.  Update Dockerfile and `.dockerignore` so you copy the `codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` inside the docker you will be building
    *   Add `!codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` to your `.dockerignore`
    *   Add the package to the docker before `RUN npm install`: `COPY codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz ./`
    *   Remove multi-stage docker steps
        -   Lines from the beginning of the file until `RUN rm -rf /package.json /package-lock.json`
        > This way you skip copying the files to the other docker, and another `npm install`

5.  Publish your docker locally as normal: `docker build -t codacy-eslint:local .`

## Limitations

### Incompatible rules

There are some ESLint rules that will be ignored when running this Docker container. For more details on the ignored rules, check `blacklistRegexes` defined at [blacklist.ts](src/blacklist.ts).

Usually, these rules need an Internet connection and/or to check `node_modules`, and would not run successfully on our Docker container environment.

## What is Codacy

[Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) is an Automated Code Review Tool that monitors your technical debt, helps you improve your code quality, teaches best practices to your developers, and helps you save time in Code Reviews.
