# Codacy ESLint test

## Adding new plugins / configs

1.  Install the package using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install <package-name>
    ```

2.  \[Plugins only\] Add the plugin to the plugins section in the file `src/eslintDefaultOptions.ts`

3.  \[Plugins only\] If the plugin has descriptions for rules on GitHub, reference them
at `src/docGeneratorMain.ts` to include them on the generated documentation. To do this, add a section similar to the following example:

    ```typescript
    console.log("Generate xss description files")
    await docGenerator.downloadDocs(
      (pattern) =>
        `${githubBaseUrl}/Rantanen/eslint-plugin-xss/master/docs/rules/${pattern}.md`,
      "xss"
    )
    ```

4.  Generate documentation so it adds the new plugin documentation

## Generating documentation

```bash
npm install
npm run generateDocs
```

## Test changes to codacy-seed locally
You may need to test changes that comes from our [codacy-engine-typescript-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-typescript-seed).

1.  Create a package with your changes on the seed:
    * Don't forget to update the dependencies: `npm install`
    * Compile the library: `npm run compile`
    * Package the library: `npm pack`
        > This should generate a codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz on your codacy-seed repository

2.  Copy the `codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` into the root of this repository

3.  Install the package: `npm install codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz`

4.  Update Dockerfile and `.dockerignore` so you copy the `codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` inside the docker you will be building
    *  Add `!codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz` to your `.dockerignore`
    *  Add the package to the docker before `RUN npm install`: `COPY codacy-seed-0.0.1.tgz ./`
    *  Remove multi-stage docker steps
        *  Lines from `FROM node:$NODE_IMAGE_VERSION` to `RUN rm -rf /package.json /package-lock.json`
        > This way you skip copying the files to the other docker, and another `npm install`

5.  Publish your docker locally as normal: `docker build -t codacy-eslint:local .`

## Limitations

### Incompatible rules

There are some ESLint rules that will be ignored when running this Docker container. For more details on the ignored
rules, check `blacklistRegexes` defined at [blacklist.ts](src/blacklist.ts).

Usually, these rules need an Internet connection and/or to check `node_modules`, and would not run successfully
on our Docker container environment.
