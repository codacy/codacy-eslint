### `space-before-generic-bracket`

_The `--fix` option on the command line automatically fixes problems reported by this rule._

Enforces consistent spacing before the opening `<` of generic type annotation parameters.

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a space before the `<`. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no space before the `<`.

The default value is `'never'`.
