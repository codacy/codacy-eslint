# Disallow `require()` expressions which import private modules (`n/no-unpublished-require`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): ☑️ `flat/recommended`, 🟢 `flat/recommended-module`, ✅ `flat/recommended-script`, ☑️ `recommended`, 🟢 `recommended-module`, ✅ `recommended-script`.

If a `require()` expression's target is not published, the program works in local, but will not work after published to npm.
This rule disallows `require()` expressions of unpublished files/modules.

## 📖 Rule Details

If a source code file satisfies all of the following conditions, the file is \*published\*.

- `"files"` field of `package.json` includes the file or `"files"` field of `package.json` does not exist.
- `.npmignore` does not include the file.

Then this rule warns `require()` expressions in \*published\* files if the `require()` expression imports \*unpublished\* files or the packages of `devDependencies`.

> This intends to prevent "Module Not Found" error after `npm publish`.\
> 💡 If you want to import `devDependencies`, please write `.npmignore` or `"files"` field of `package.json`.
