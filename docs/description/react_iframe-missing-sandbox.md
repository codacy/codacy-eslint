# Enforce sandbox attribute on iframe elements (`react/iframe-missing-sandbox`)

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe. Using sandbox attribute is considered a good security practice.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox>

## Rule Details

This rule checks all React iframe elements and verifies that there is sandbox attribute and that it's value is valid. In addition to that it also reports cases where attribute contains `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` at the same time as this combination allows the embedded document to remove the sandbox attribute and bypass the restrictions.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```jsx
var React = require('react');

var Frame = () => (
    <div>
        <iframe></iframe>
        {React.createElement('iframe')}
    </div>
);
```

The following patterns are **not** considered warnings:

```jsx
var React = require('react');

var Frame = <iframe sandbox="allow-popups"/>;
var Frame = () => (
    <div>
        <iframe sandbox="allow-popups"></iframe>
        {React.createElement('iframe', { sandbox: "allow-popups" })}
    </div>
);
```
