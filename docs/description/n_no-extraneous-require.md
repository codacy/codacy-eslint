# Disallow `require()` expressions which import extraneous modules (`n/no-extraneous-require`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): ☑️ `flat/recommended`, 🟢 `flat/recommended-module`, ✅ `flat/recommended-script`, ☑️ `recommended`, 🟢 `recommended-module`, ✅ `recommended-script`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If a `require()`'s target is extraneous (it's not written in `package.json`), the program works in local, but will not work after dependencies are re-installed. It will cause troubles to your team/contributors.
This rule disallows `require()` of extraneous modules.
