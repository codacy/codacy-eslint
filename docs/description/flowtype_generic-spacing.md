### `generic-spacing`

_The `--fix` option on the command line automatically fixes problems reported by this rule._

Enforces consistent spacing within generic type annotation parameters.

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a space surrounding the generic type parameters. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no space surrounding the generic type parameters.

The default value is `'never'`.
