### `union-intersection-spacing`

_The `--fix` option on the command line automatically fixes problems reported by this rule._

Enforces consistent spacing around union and intersection type separators (`|` and `&`).

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no space around the separator. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a space around the separator.

The default value is `'always'`.
