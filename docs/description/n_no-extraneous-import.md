# Disallow `import` declarations which import extraneous modules (`n/no-extraneous-import`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the âœ… `recommended` [config](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If an `import` declaration's source is extraneous (it's not written in `package.json`), the program works in local, but will not work after dependencies are re-installed. It will cause troubles to your team/contributors.
This rule disallows `import` declarations of extraneous modules.

## ðŸ“– Rule Details

This rule warns `import` declarations of extraneous modules.

### Options

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "n/no-extraneous-import": ["error", {
            "allowModules": [],
            "resolvePaths": []
        }]
    }
}
```

#### allowModules

Some platforms have additional embedded modules.
For example, Electron has `electron` module.

We can specify additional embedded modules with this option.
This option is an array of strings as module names.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "n/no-extraneous-import": ["error", {
            "allowModules": ["electron"]
        }]
    }
}
```

#### resolvePaths

Adds additional paths to try for when resolving imports.
If a path is relative, it will be resolved from CWD.

Default is `[]`

#### convertPath

- `exclude`: TODO
- `include`: TODO
- `replace`: TODO

### Shared Settings

The following options can be set by [shared settings](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html#adding-shared-settings).
Several rules have the same option, but we can set this option at once.

- `allowModules`
- `resolvePaths`

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
    "settings": {
        "node": {
            "allowModules": ["electron"],
            "resolvePaths": [__dirname],
        }
    },
    "rules": {
        "n/no-extraneous-import": "error"
    }
}
```
