ðŸ’¡ This rule is manually fixable by [editor suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts#rule-suggestions).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Some HTML elements have a specific set of valid values for some attributes.
For instance the elements: `a`, `area`, `link`, or `form` all have an attribute called `rel`.
There is a fixed list of values that have any meaning for this attribute on these tags (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)).
To help with minimizing confusion while reading code, only the appropriate values should be on each attribute.
